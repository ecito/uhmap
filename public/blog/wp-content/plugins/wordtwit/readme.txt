WordTwit is a plugin that uses the Twitter API to automatically push a published post to your Twitter account as a tweet, and as of Version 2.0, can do a whole lot more too!

== Description ==

WordTwit keeps track of when you publish new posts, and automatically informs
all followers by pushing out a Twitter tweet.  All links are
automatically converted to tiny URLs to save space.  Most users see a
substantial increase in blog traffic after tweeting their posts on a frequent
basis. 

As of version 2.0, you can now choose to include/exclude posts to be Tweeted by tag(s)/category(s), choose to have all your links automatically shortened, show a banner for your Twitter account when visitors click outbound links, new link view statistics in the admin, and much more!
